My name is Lakshy Sharma, and I am a software developer based in India. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electronics and Communications from Gujarat Technical University, and I specialize in working with computer networks and building network-related software.

In 2021, I started my career with [Whizhack Technologies](https://whizhack.com), an Indian startup that develops cybersecurity products for medium-scale businesses. During my time at Whizhack Technologies, I worked as a DevOps engineer and had the privilege to collaborate with some of the best engineers in the industry to develop the security products TRACE and Zerohack XDR. This role provided me with valuable experience in building, deploying, and maintaining large-scale systems using the latest technologies.

When I'm not developing software, I enjoy playing chess, reading books, and listening to technical podcasts. I also like to build custom operating systems and learn about Linux. As an avid fan of Unix philosophy, I often contemplate what good software design should look like.

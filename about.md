Hello readers. I am Lakshy Sharma. I am a software developer from India.
I have a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communications from Gujarat Technical University.
I specialize in working with computer networks and building network-related software.

I started my career in 2021 with [Whizhack Technologies](https://whizhack.com), an Indian startup that creates cybersecurity products for medium-scale businesses. During my time at Whizhack Technologies, I got the opportunity to work with some of the best engineers to develop the security products [TRACE and Zerohack XDR](https://www.whizhack.com/products/). I worked as a DevOps engineer and learned the crucial skills required to build, deploy and maintain large scalable systems using the latest technologies.

When I am not developing software. I like to play chess, read books, listen to technical podcasts or build custom operating systems and learn Linux.
I am also an avid fan of Unix philosophy and how it approaches problem-solving. So I often ponder about what a good software design should look like.
